    <h1>The World is F*cked Up:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Reagan ruined everything.
        Trump is a dictator.
        Corporations own your data.
        The rich write the laws.
        Billionaires shouldn’t exist.
        They hoard while people starve.
        War is profit.
        Weapons are business deals.
        Healthcare is a product, not a right.
        Ambulances cost thousands.
        Police don’t keep us safe.
        They protect the rich.
        Zuckerberg sells your life to the highest bidder.
        They kill and walk free.
        Climate change is ignored.
        Oil companies lie.
        The air is toxic.
        The ocean is plastic.
        The news is a distraction.
        Every network has a sponsor.
        The planet is burning.
        And they tell you "it’s complicated", while people are starving, children are homeless, and wages haven’t changed in decades.
        Rent keeps rising.
        Everything is monetized.
        You pay to exist.
        Education is a scam.
        Bezos exploits workers for same-day delivery.
        College means debt, not opportunity.
        Teachers are underpaid.
        They gaslight you daily.
        They sell you lies.
        History was rewritten.
        They erased the truth.
        The algorithm controls you.
        You’re not the customer, <strong>you’re the product.</strong>
        Democracy is crumbling.
        Voting feels useless.
        Everyone’s tired.
        Everyone’s broke.
        No one’s listening.
        Everything’s a subscription, even water.
        Mental health is profit.
        Therapy is luxury.
        Privacy is dead.
        You’re tracked 24/7.
        Children are in cages.
        People are in prison for profit.
        America exports war.
        Cops lie.
        Musk plays god with no consequences.
        Judges are bought.
        The internet is censored.
        Real activists are silenced.
        The rest are influencers.
        Money wins elections.
        Lobbyists write the bills.
        AI is replacing you.
        And they’ll call it progress.
        The government doesn’t care.
        It’s all theater.
        Water isn’t free.
        Healthcare isn’t a right.
        Reality is curated.
        Everything is aesthetic, curated, fake.
        We scroll while Rome burns.
        We post while people die.
        Everything is content.
        Nothing feels real.
        They numb you with noise.
        They distract you with trends.
        They profit from division.
        They keep you fighting each other.
        They want you angry, but not organized.

        Epstein had a list. We never got the list.
        They protected him and they protect each other.
